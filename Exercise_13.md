  We use different method to investigate the power spectrum of guitar string.
# Background
  The central equation of wave motion is

  Gaussian initial string displacement y0=e^[-k(x-x0)^2] is convenient for the calculations of this section,but are not very realistic
  
  When a real string, for example, a guitar string,is plucked, the initial string displacement is more accurately described by two straight lines that start at the end of the string and end at the excitation point,just as the follow picture

# Main body
  First,we suppose the pluck happened at 35 percent from one end
  
  When we use Gaussian initial string displacement

  When we use more realistic initial string displacement

  And then,we suppose the pluck happened at 50 percent from one end
