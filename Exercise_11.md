# Abstract
  As we have known,Hyperion has an unusual shape,leading to its different behavior.Hyperion is shaped more like an egg and its orbit is choatic. We are now studying the behavior of our model for Hyperion for different initial conditions.
# Background

  Hyperion, also known as Saturn VII (7), is a moon of Saturn discovered by William Cranch Bond, George Phillips Bond and William Lassell in 1848. It is distinguished by its irregular shape, its chaotic rotation, and its unexplained sponge-like appearance. It was the first non-round moon to be discovered.

  Hyperion is one of the largest bodies known to be highly irregularly shaped (non-ellipsoidal, i.e. not in hydrostatic equilibrium) in the Solar System.

  Hyperion's rotation is chaotic, that is, its axis of rotation wobbles so much that its orientation in space is unpredictable.
# Main body & Conclusion
  We think the behavior when the orbit is circular

  We think the behavior when the orbit is elloptical

  Then we plot the difference between two results for θ(t) with different inital conditions.We use θ(0)=0 for one trajectory and θ(0)=0.01 for the other.

  Then we show the results for Δθ as continous

# Conclusion
  This model is sensitive for initial condition.
  The origin of these dips is that the angle difference decreases as the angular velocity of the larger angle changes from positive to negative.
